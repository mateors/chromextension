### What do you mean by "on steroids"
used for saying that something is an extreme example or version of something:
He described the new edifices as "architecture on steroids".
People flocked to West Berlin in search of an alternative life in a liberal society. It was like Amsterdam on steroids.

## Where this idea came from?
"I started working on Pushbullet because I wanted it to be easier to move things between my phone and computer. Google's Chrome-to-Phone opened my eyes to the possibilities so I ran with what started out as 'Chrome-to-Phone on steroids'. It's since grown a lot from that, but the entire concept goes back to making it a single-click operation to get something from your computer to your phone. Now, Pushbullet makes moving anything between any device as easy as we've been able to make it."
